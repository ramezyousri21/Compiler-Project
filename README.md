# Compilers Project

# Idea
The aim of this project is to create 2 phases of a compiler lexical analysis and syntax analysis 
(Lexer and Parser) for AINSI C language

The application consists of 3 parts:
* GUI – a way for the user to interact with the backend of the application
* Lexer – The part where the compiler transforms the input source code into a set of 
tokens in order to be processed with the parser
* Parser – The part where the syntax analysis occurs , it takes the set of input tokens and 
uses one of the many parsing algorithms to parse the code and check the syntax
