#Idea
The part where the syntax analysis occurs , it takes the set of input tokens and 
uses one of the many parsing algorithms to parse the code and check the syntax

The application consists of 3 parts:
* GUI – a way for the user to interact with the backend of the application
* Lexer – The part where the compiler transforms the input source code into a set of 
tokens in order to be processed with the parser
* Parser – The part where the syntax analysis occurs , it takes the set of input tokens and 
uses one of the many parsing algorithms to parse the code and check the syntax
